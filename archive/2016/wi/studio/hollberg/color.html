<p>Color | Studio Task #4</p>
<p>For this assignment, I chose to design the template as if the site were for a teen female magazine like Seventeen or Cosmopolitan. At first I tried to go for a professional look using a split complimentary color palette of dark blue and dark yellows, however, none of these colors really popped or seemed feminine enough. At this point, I changed my strategy by first removing all the borders to encourage a softer look and then by changing my color palette. I wanted darker colors for text and a light, but still fun color for the background. I decided on an analogous color scheme, to emphasize the feminine colors of pink and purple. The header and footer text are in a dark pink color and the navigation (sidebar and nag bar) are in a bright purple color. These highly saturated, bright colors make these actionable elements more obvious. As these elements do not include a huge amount of space, the intense colors are not too overwhelming. For the content text, I chose a dark grey color that was non-offensive. This was after making the text the purple color, which was too intense and hard to read. For the background, I used another analogous color of pink, but a much less saturated version. I chose this color as it helps the page to feel youthful without being overbearing (as a more saturated version might be). Additionally, I played around with removing one color, and found that the best color to remove was the background color (leaving it just white). In the final version I left the background in as I feel it gives it a more fun, youthful feel.</p>
